## 📌 What is Perspective Matters?
Perspective Matters is an AI-powered debate simulation app where two intelligent AI agents engage in structured debates on any topic. The app challenges biases, breaks echo chambers, and fosters critical thinking by presenting both sides of an argument in a dynamic and engaging format.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI vs. AI Debates** – Two AI-powered debaters take opposing sides on any given topic.
- **Structured Arguments** – AI follows strict debating principles to keep arguments logical, concise, and impactful.
- **Topic Validation** – Ensures only meaningful, debatable topics are used.
- **Real-World & Philosophical Topics** – Debates cover everything from AI ethics to free will to government policies to anything that is possible to be debated.

## ⚙️ How It Works
